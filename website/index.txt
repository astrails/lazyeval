h1. &#x2192; 'lazyeval'


h2. What

This gem provides a very simple lazy evaluation for Ruby

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install lazyeval</pre>

h2. The basics

This GEM allows to call methods lazily. i.e. the actual work will not be
performed until the result is used.  There's no promise/force semantics. just a
single call (or block) is stored and executed the first time the (lazy) result
is accessed.

h2. Demonstration of usage

# simple lazy call
user = User.lazy.find(:first) # will not access a db
puts user.name # this will actually perform the find and then get the name from
               # the result

# example for a lazy block
user_name = User.lazy { |user| user.find(:first).user_name } # no db access
puts user_name # db will be accessed here
